Alright, here’s the mission: take a project, toss it into GitHub, and make it shine. We’re talking branches for days, commits like a pro, and pull requests that’ll make even the toughest devs nod in approval. Tasks? Editing files, adding some stylish CSS, and throwing in an image and alert—because why not? Each task gets its own branch, because we don’t mix greatness with greatness. 

Follow the flow: issue → branch → commit → PR → merge. In short, it's Git, but with swagger.


Known Bugs:

-  Security code now requires 6 digits, but anything less gets rejected like it's underdressed for a royal event.
-  Character limit for the security code is set to 6; anything longer gets cut off—no VIP entry for extra characters.
-  Submit button styling updated from blue to green, so it might surprise you if you’re still looking for the old blue look.
-  CSS adjustments might occasionally over-center attributes.
-  Page now displays an alert on load—don’t say I didn’t warn you.
